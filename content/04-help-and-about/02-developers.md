This page is for anyone who wants to know how the site is built, contribute a fix or a new page, or get in touch with the person maintaining it.

## About this project

This is an independent study-guide project built and maintained by **Samuel O'Connell**, part of the [UTC Leeds T Level Study Guides](https://lana6478.github.io/utc-leeds-t-levels/) family.

## How the site is built

The whole project is two things living in one repository:

- **`content/`** - the actual study-guide library: plain markdown files, organised into folders by topic.
- **`docs/`** - a small, dependency-free static website (plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, plus [marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) for rendering markdown in the browser) built for GitHub Pages. It reads its page list and page content from `docs/content/`, a generated mirror of `content/` - so the website always shows exactly what's in the file library.

There's no build framework, no bundler, and no server-side code.

## Rebuilding the site after an edit

After adding, editing or removing anything under `content/` (or `assets/`), regenerate the site data from the repository root:

```bash
python3 tools/build_site.py
```

This copies every file from `content/` into `docs/content/`, copies shared images from `assets/img/` into `docs/assets/img/`, and rebuilds `docs/assets/data/manifest.json` (sidebar tree) and `docs/assets/data/search-index.json` (search index).

Then preview it locally:

```bash
cd docs
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

## Lesson slides

The PowerPoint lesson decks under `content/05-teaching-resources/slides/` are generated, not hand-made. Each deck's content lives in a short Python file in `tools/slides/decks/`, and `tools/slides/render.py` turns it into a styled `.pptx` with the same lesson shape every time: objectives and starter, teaching slides, a quiz with answers, an activity and an exit ticket, with teacher notes on every slide.

Most topics also have a fuller explanation slide and a short quick-check slide (answers in the speaker notes). Their text lives in `tools/slides/decks/explain/`, matched to slides by deck file and slide title.

To change or add a deck, edit its content file, then rebuild the decks and the site:

```bash
pip install python-pptx
python3 tools/slides/build_slides.py
python3 tools/build_site.py
```

`build_slides.py` also writes the [Lesson Slides](../05-teaching-resources/01-lesson-slides.md) index page, refreshes the "Teaching resources" table on each topic page, and adds a "Lesson slides for this section" link at the end of each matching section of text. `tools/slides/decks/placement.py` says which sections each deck belongs under. Everything the script adds sits between `teaching-resources` or `lesson-slide` comment markers, so never edit those parts by hand. It refuses to build if a deck contains an em or en dash, and prints a warning for any slide where text might overflow.

## Contributing a page

1. Add a new `.md` file under the right `content/` subfolder, following the existing page template: an `# H1` title, an italic breadcrumb line, `##` sections, a closing **Key terms** list, and a **Related pages** list of relative links to nearby pages.
2. Keep filenames lowercase and hyphenated, with a number prefix (`01-`, `02-`, ...) where order matters.
3. Run `python3 tools/build_site.py` so the website picks up the change.
4. Open a pull request.

## License and content note

This project paraphrases and reorganises the official T Level Technical Qualification in Digital Software Development specification (Pearson, v1.1, August 2026) for easier navigation. It is unofficial and unaffiliated with Pearson or the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE). See [Sources and Further Reading](../sources-and-further-reading.md) for the primary, authoritative documents.

## Key terms

- **`content/`** - the canonical markdown study-guide library.
- **`docs/`** - the generated GitHub Pages website that reads from `content/`.
- **`tools/build_site.py`** - the script that mirrors `content/` into `docs/content/` and rebuilds the site's directory tree and search index.
- **`tools/slides/build_slides.py`** - the script that generates the lesson-slide PowerPoints and links them into the topic pages.
